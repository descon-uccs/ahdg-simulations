# ahdg-simulations

Each .ipynb contains the source code used to generate the plots generated in the work.
The first cell contains all functions used in the experiments.
In both cases, both ipynbs implement (simCTI,simSISGCG) which are functions that run a single (random) trial of the respective experiment, using utility and learning functions generated from other source code in the block.
The following block in each .ipynbs produce the experiments in the work by initializing initial conditions and functions and then passing it to simCTI/simSISGCG function which run a trial.
Once the desired number of runs are recorded, the data is aggregated in formatted in the plot.
Note that in each case we set the seed using np.random.seed(0), which ensures running the code replicated the plots in the work even though the simulations are random.
